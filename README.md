# Prodigy InfoTech Internship: Data Exploration & Analysis

Welcome to this repository, which showcases my work for Task 2 of the Prodigy InfoTech Internship. This task emphasizes the processes of data preparation, in-depth exploratory analysis, and drawing meaningful interpretations from raw data.

## Task Summary

For this task, I conducted data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of my choiceâ€”such as the popular Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal was to examine relationships among features, uncover underlying trends, and gain a deeper understanding of the dataset's structure.

## Skills & Experience Gained

Working on this task significantly strengthened my knowledge in data preprocessing and EDA techniques. I developed practical skills in cleaning real-world data, analyzing variable interactions, and deriving insights that support informed decision-making.
